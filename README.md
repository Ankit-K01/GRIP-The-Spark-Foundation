# GRIP-The-Spark-Foundation
Hello, I'm Ankit and this is my repository of tasks that I have completed while doing the internship at The Spark Foundation

Task 1
Supervised Machine Learning Prediction
- Estimate a student's score based on their study hours.
- What score can we expect if a student studies for 9.25 hours a day?
- This task is a straightforward linear regression problem, involving just two variables.
- Dataset: http://bit.ly/w-data

Task 2
Unsupervised Machine Learning Prediction
- Using the 'Iris' dataset, determine the optimal number of clusters and visualize the results.
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 3
Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conduct an 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset.
- As a business manager, identify areas for improvement to increase profitability.
- What business problems can be identified through data exploration?
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

Task 4
Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
- Perform 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on the 'Global Terrorism' dataset.
- As a security/defense analyst, locate areas with a high incidence of terrorism.
- What security issues and insights can be gained through EDA?
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

Task 5
Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
- Conduct 'Exploratory Data Analysis' on the 'Indian Premier League' dataset.
- As a sports analyst, identify the most successful teams, players, and factors influencing team performance.
- Recommend teams or players for product endorsements.
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

Task 6
Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
- Build a Decision Tree classifier and create a graphical visualization.
- The objective is to make accurate class predictions when new data is fed into the classifier.
- Dataset: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

Task 7
Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
- Goal: Develop a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction by analyzing historical stock prices and sentiment in news headlines.
- Analyze the SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX) stock.
- Obtain historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com.
- Retrieve textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

Task 8
Timeline Analysis: Covid-19
- Create a storyboard depicting the spread of Covid-19 cases in a chosen region (e.g., Asia, Europe, BRICS) using Tableau, Power BI, or SAP.
- Utilize animation, a timeline, and annotations to craft engaging and interactive dashboards and stories.
- Identify notable patterns and potential factors contributing to the spread of Covid-19, employing both basic and advanced charts.
- Record the finished storyboard with audio commentary, explaining the charts and offering recommendations.
- Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on https://bit.ly/30d2gdi
